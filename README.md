# OpenAI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Company: ![OpenAI](OpenAI-image.jpeg)

* OpenAI was founded December 2015.  OpenAI is not incorporated, as of 2019 it is a privately owned "capped" for-profit.

* Founders of OpenAI: Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Wojciech Zaremba, John Schulman, Elon Musk 

* The idea for the OpenAI came about to:
 > develop "safe and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work"[1]

* OpenAI began as a non-profit.  OpenAI raised $130M between 2015-2019. Mainly, OpenAI is funded by via its for-profit subsidiary, introduced in 2019, OpenAI Global, LLC.  Microsoft owns roughly 49% of OpenAI's equity, having invested $13B. Microsoft also provides computing resources via MS Azure.  In 2019, OpenAI went from non-profit to "capped" for-profit (profit is capped at 100 times any investment). How much funding have they received? After becoming a "capped" for-profit, Microsoft announced an investment package of $1B into OpenAI, which could be spent as soon as 2024. 1/23/23, Microsoft announced a new $10B investment in OpenAI Global, over multipe years.  So, adding up all those previous numbers, total funding is currently around $24.130B[11]

## Business Activities

* The specific problem the company is trying to solve is: 
 > "to build safe AI, and ensure AI’s benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible."[12]

* OpenAI's intended customer is anyone who wants a search engine that is more intelligent than Google's traditional search engine (Google now has "Bard," its AI search engine). Currently, Microsoft is OpenAI's major customer.  Microsoft hopes to integrate OpenAI into Bing, Edge & MS 365. While I could not find info regarding the market size of this set of customers, Microsoft is one of the largest global technology companies. 

* OpenAI offers competitors a more mature AI tool than competitors.  That is, OpenAI seems to be slightly ahead of other competitors as of this writing, Aug 2024. 

* Technologies OpenAI currently uses:

  *RoboSumo* - virtual world where humanoid metalearning robots have to learn basics as if they were infants, adversarial learning process

  *Gym Retro* - platform for reinforcement learning research on video games[2]

  *OpenAI Five* - a team of 5 OpenAI-curated bots that learn to play against human players at a high skill level entirely through trial-and-error algorithms. Utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL)

  *Multi* - a collaboraton platform based on Zoom.

  *Strawberry* - technology that lets AI plan ahead, navigate the internet by itself and conduct "deep research"[3][4]

  *Dactyl* - used machine learning to train a human-like robot hand to manipulate physical objects

  *API* - a multi-purpose API "for accessing new AI models developed by OpenAI" to let developers call on it for "any English language AI task"[5][6]

  *GPT* - Generative Pretrained Transformer; text generation   [infamous chatgpt tool](https://chatgpt.com/)

  *CLIP* - Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training; analyzes similarities between text and images

  *DALL-E* - Transformer model that creates images from text descriptions

  *Whisper* - Speech recognition model

  *MuseNet* - deep neural net trained to predict subsequent musical notes in MIDI music files

  *Jukebox* - open-sourced algorithm to generate music with vocals

## Landscape

* OpenAI is in the field of Artificial Intelligence

* What have been the major trends and innovations of AI over the last 5-10 years?
 1. **Deep Learning and Neural Networks**
Trending in AI is the development of sophisticated deep learning models versus traditional neural networks.  Deep learning modesl use three or more layers, and oftentimes hundreds and thousands of layers, to train AI models. While traditional machine learning models use simple neural networks with one or two computational layers.[8] 
 2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
NLP enables computers to understand and create text and speech by combining linguistics, the rule-based modeling of human language, with statistical modeling, machine learning and deep learning.[9]  Improved language models over the past 5-10 years mean enhanced ability of machine to understand and generate human language. 
3. **Generative AI**
Generative AI looks at past artifacts, learns, then generates new artifacts.  Generative AI can generate images, video, music, speech, text, software code and product designs.[9]

* What are the other major companies in this field?
Here are 13 other companies that are also in AI[10]:
1. Google 
2. Microsoft
3. IBM
4. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
5. NVIDIA
6. Meta (formerly Facebook)
7. Salesforce
8. Baidu
9. Tencent
10. Apple
11. Intel
12. Huawei
13. Adobe

## Results

* What has been the business impact of OpenAI so far?

 "OpenAI’s revenues have surpassed $2bn on an annualised basis, as the runaway success of its flagship artificial intelligence product ChatGPT puts it among the fastest-growing technology companies in history."[7]

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in the field of AI use to measure success? How is OpenAI performing based on these metrics?

Some of the core metrics AI companies use to measure success are:
 1. Model Performance Metrics - Accuracy; the percentage of correct predictions made by the model
 2. Innovaton & Research Metrics - Number of publications & citations
 3. Adoption & Utilization Metrics - Customer adoption, usage & market share
 4. Business Impact Metrics - Revenue, Profitability, Cost Savings & Efficiency Gains 
 5. Technical & Operational Metrics - Model Training Time & System Uptime 
OpenAI is performing well in all of the above metrics.  OpenAI's GPT-3 & 4 show high performance in generating coherent text. OpenAI has published numerous influential papers & patents regarding AI research & specific technologies. Customers do adopt OpenAI's models.  OpenAI's API for GPT-3 has seen extensive usage.  OpenAI is generating significant revenue.  Business pay for OpenAI because it improves efficiencies and reduces costs.  Finally, OpenAI has high uptime for its API services.

* How is OpenAI performing relative to competitors in the AI field?
How is OpenAI performing relative to competitors in the AI field OpenAI is a leader in AI.  OpenAI is known for its advanced language models and significant research contributions.  However, competition remains robust against Google DeepMind, Microsoft, IBM & others. Each major player contributes their own strengths and innovations to the field of AI.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise OpenAI, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
 I have read that Google DeepMind has done well in the field of medicine, by predicting protein structures. I think that OpenAI should also focus on the field of medicine.  

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Medicine is such an enormous area of explosive growth.  I expect that OpenAI could benefit financially from predicting future medical trends or more specific medical procedures. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
 I think that OpenAI would need to create new technologies in order to compete with Google DeepMind's reinforcement learning. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
DeepMind is supposed to excel in complex problem-solving while OpenAI excels in natural language processing(NLP). So, OpenAI should take a page from Google and focus on a new technology to improve reinforcement learning.  Hopefully, that would help OpenAI to make strides in the field of medicine.
