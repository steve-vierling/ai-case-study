# OpenAI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Company: OpenAI

* OpenAI was founded December 2015.  OpenAI is not incorporated, as of 2019 it is a privately owned "capped" for-profit.

* Founders of OpenAI: Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Wojciech Zaremba, John Schulman, Elon Musk 

* The idea for the company came about with the mission to develop "safe and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work"[1]

* OpenAI began as a non-profit.  OpenAI raised $130M between 2015-2019. Mainly, OpenAI is funded by via its for-profit subsidiary, introduced in 2019, OpenAI Global, LLC.  Microsoft owns roughly 49% of OpenAI's equity, having invested $13B. Microsoft also provides computing resources via MS Azure.  In 2019, OpenAI went from non-profit to "capped" for-profit (profit is capped at 100 times any investment). How much funding have they received? After becoming a "capped" for-profit, Microsoft announced an investment package of $1B into OpenAI, which could be spent as soon as 2024. 1/23/23, Microsoft announced a new $10B investment in OpenAI Global, over multipe years.  So, adding up all those previous numbers, total funding is currently around $24.130B

## Business Activities

* The specific problem the company is trying to solve is to develop "safe and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work"[1]

* OpenAI's intended customer is anyone who wants a search engine that is more intelligent than Google's traditional search engine (Google now has "Bard," its AI search engine). Currently, Microsoft is OpenAI's major customer.  Microsoft hopes to integrate OpenAI into Bing, Edge & MS 365. While I could not find info regarding the market size of this set of customers, Microsoft is one of the largest global technolgy companies. 

* OpenAI offers competitors a more mature AI tool than competitors.  That is, OpenAI seems to be slightly ahead of other competitors as of this writing, Aug 2024. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
* Technologies OpenAI currently uses:
  RoboSumo - virtual world where humanoid metalearning robots have to learn basics as if they were infants, adversarial learning process
  Gym Retro - platform for reinforcement learning research on video games[2]
  OpenAI Five: a team of 5 OpenAI-curated bots that learn to play against human players at a high skill level entirely through trial-and-error algorithms. Utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL)

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise OpenAI, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
 I have read that Google DeepMind has done well in the field of medicine, by predicting protein structures. I think that OpenAI should also focus on the field of medicine.  

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Medicine is such an enormous area of explosive growth.  I expect that OpenAI could benefit financially from predicting future medical trends or more specific medical procedures. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
 I think that OpenAI would need to create new technologies in order to compete with Google DeepMind's reinforcement learning. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
DeepMind is supposed to excel in complex problem-solving while OpenAI excels in natural language processing(NLP). So, OpenAI should take a page from Google and focus a new technology on excelling in reinforcement learning.  Hopefully, that would help OpenAI to make strides in the field of medicine.
